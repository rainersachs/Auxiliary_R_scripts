#Customized software for analyzing simulated Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) effects. Concerns tumorigenesis in murine Harderian Glands (HG) or other mouse sites induced by irradiation at the National Space Research Laboratory (NSRL) accelerator. Also includes scripts for other human cancer surrogate endpoints such as mouse chromosome aberrations. Emphasizes models for 1-ion beam effects and mathematical synergy calculations for effects of multi-ion beams of simulated mixed GCR fields.  The synergy analysis is still under construction.
