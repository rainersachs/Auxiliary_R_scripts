# NASAmouse
#Customized software for analyzing simulated Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) effects. Concerns tumorigenesis in murine Harderian Glands (HG) or other mouse sites induced by irradiation at the National Space Research Laboratory (NSRL) accelerator. Emphasizes models for 1-ion beam effects and mathematical synergy calculations for effects of multi-ion beams of simulated mixed GCR fields.  The modeling includes calibration of parameters by non-linear inverse variance weighted least square regression from the data, information coefficient calculations, and using variance covariance matrices to take adjustable parameter correlations into account. The synergy analysis includes calculations of 95% confidence limits for calculated baseline mixture dose-effect relations that define absence of synergy and absence of antagonism.
