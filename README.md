#Customized software for analyzing simulated Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) effects. Contains miscellaneous scripts that are potentially useful in several different repositories of the sachs-huang organization. Emphasizes mathematical synergy calculations for effects of multi-ion beams of simulated mixed GCR fields. The synergy analysis includes calculations of 95% confidence limits for calculated baseline mixture dose-effect relations that define absence of synergy and absence of antagonism.
